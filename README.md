Offline-First AI Voice Assistant
This is a high-performance, offline-first voice assistant built with Next.js and modern web technologies. The application records microphone input, transcribes the speech locally in the browser using a WASM-powered model, sends the resulting text to the Google Gemini API for a response, synthesizes the reply back to audio locally, and plays it back to the user.

The core design prioritizes speed and privacy by performing all intensive AI tasks (Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech) directly on the client-side, ensuring that only the transcribed text is sent over the network.

### Tech Stack

Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router) with TypeScript

Local AI Models: Hugging Face Transformers.js (@xenova/transformers)

Speech-to-Text (STT): Xenova/whisper-base

Text-to-Speech (TTS): Xenova/speecht5_tts with Xenova/speecht5_vocoder

LLM: Google Gemini API (gemini-1.5-flash)

Offline Caching: Browser Cache (via Transformers.js internal caching)

Audio Processing: Web Workers API, Web Audio API (MediaRecorder)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Deployment: Vercel

### Features
Offline-First Architecture: After the initial load, the AI models are cached by the browser, allowing the app to run without re-downloading them.

Local Speech-to-Text: Voice is transcribed directly in the browser using a Web Worker, ensuring privacy and low latency. No audio is ever sent to a server.

LLM Integration: Seamlessly connects to the Google Gemini API for intelligent, conversational responses.

Local Text-to-Speech: The AI's text response is converted into natural-sounding speech directly in the browser using a second Web Worker.

Performance Monitoring: The UI displays the latency for each step of the pipeline (STT, LLM, TTS) for every interaction.

### Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or later recommended)

npm or yarn

### Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/The-morning-star23/VoiceAssistant.git
cd offline -voice-assistant

Install dependencies:

npm install

Set up environment variables:

Create a new file in the root of your project named .env.local.

Get a free API key from Google AI Studio.

Add your key to the .env.local file:

GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here

Run the development server:

npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

Deployment
This project is optimized for deployment on Vercel.

Push your code to a GitHub repository.

Import the project on Vercel. Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js framework.

Configure Environment Variables: In the Vercel project settings, go to "Environment Variables" and add your GOOGLE_API_KEY with the same value from your .env.local file. This is a crucial step.

Deploy. Vercel will handle the rest.

### Performance Report

The application was designed to be highly responsive. The performance metrics below were observed on a standard machine with a good network connection.

Speech-to-Text (STT) Latency: Approximately [Enter your STT time here, e.g., 1500] ms on the first run, and [e.g., 800] ms on subsequent runs.

LLM API Latency: Averaged around [Enter your LLM time here, e.g., 900] ms.

Text-to-Speech (TTS) Latency: Approximately [Enter your TTS time here, e.g., 2000] ms on the first run, and [e.g., 1200] ms on subsequent runs.

Total Response Time: The total time from the end of user speech to the start of audio playback was consistently under [Enter your total time here, e.g., 3] seconds after the initial model load.

The long initial latencies for STT and TTS are due to the one-time download and initialization of the AI models. Subsequent uses are significantly faster as the models are served from the browser's cache.



Performance Report
This report details the performance and latency of the AI Voice Assistant, measured on a standard machine with a stable internet connection. The primary performance goal was to achieve a total response time of under 1.2 seconds from the end of user speech to the start of audio playback.

Methodology
Latency was measured for the three critical stages of the pipeline using the browser's performance.now() API:

Speech-to-Text (STT): Time taken for the local Whisper model to transcribe the recorded audio into text.

LLM API: The network round-trip time to send the text to the Google Gemini API and receive a response.

Text-to-Speech (TTS): Time taken for the local SpeechT5 model to synthesize the AI's text response into playable audio.

Results
A key finding is the significant performance difference between the first interaction and all subsequent interactions.

First Interaction (Model Caching)
The first time a user interacts with the assistant, the transformers.js library downloads and caches the large STT and TTS models in the browser. This results in a one-time, significant delay.

STT Latency: ~75,238 ms (~75 seconds)

LLM API Latency: ~1,796 ms (~1.8 seconds)

TTS Latency: ~71,295 ms (~71 seconds)

Total Response Time: ~148,329 ms (~2.5 minutes)

This initial delay is expected behavior and ensures that future interactions are significantly faster.

Subsequent Interactions (From Cache)
Once the models are cached by the browser, the application's true performance becomes evident. The STT and TTS latencies drop dramatically as they are now running entirely locally without any network delay.

STT Latency: [Enter your faster STT time here, e.g., ~950 ms]

LLM API Latency: [Enter your faster LLM time here, e.g., ~1100 ms]

TTS Latency: [Enter your faster TTS time here, e.g., ~1500 ms]

Total Response Time: [Enter your faster Total time here, e.g., ~3.5 seconds]

Conclusion
The application successfully demonstrates the viability of running complex AI models for speech processing directly in the browser. While the initial, one-time model download is lengthy, subsequent interactions are much faster, relying only on the network for the quick LLM API call.

The target response time of < 1.2 seconds is highly ambitious for a fully local pipeline of this nature, especially with the non-quantized base models. However, the architecture is sound, and the application feels responsive after the initial setup. The performance meets the core requirement of an offline-first design where the heaviest processing is handled on the client-side.
